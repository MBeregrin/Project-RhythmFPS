# Project-RhythmFPS
Rhythm-based FPS game where players fight zombies synced to the beat. Includes both single-player and 1v1 multiplayer modes.

🧟‍♂️ RhythmFPS

A rhythm-based FPS built with Unity — where the music controls the battlefield.
Face waves of zombies that spawn perfectly in sync with the beat. The tempo rises, drops, and reshapes the fight in real time.

🎮 Game Concept

Every beat changes the battlefield.
Songs speed up, slow down, and the zombie waves follow their rhythm — creating a mix of chaos and flow.

🕹️ Modes: Single Player & 1v1 Versus

🎵 Dynamic Rhythm System: Zombies spawn and react to the song’s BPM and structure

👤 Customization: Player character, headphones, weapons — even bullet visuals

🧊 Art Style: Low-poly / cartoony visuals with atmospheric lighting

⚔️ Endless Arena: You can’t see the end — only feel the rhythm
